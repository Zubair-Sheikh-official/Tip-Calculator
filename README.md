# Tip-Calculator
The Tip Calculator project is a simple Python program that helps calculate the tip amount and the total bill based on the user's input of the total amount and the desired tip percentage. It is designed to assist individuals in quickly determining the appropriate tip to add to their bill when dining at a restaurant or receiving personal services.
The repository encourages collaboration and provides an avenue for interested individuals to access and contribute to the project, fostering a community of users supporting each other in the realm of tipping etiquette.
